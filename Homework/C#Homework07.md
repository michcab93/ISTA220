1. What is a class ? According to the book, what does a class “arrange?”
``A class is a system that arranges information and behaviors into groups``

2. What are the two purposes of encapsulation ?
`` The purpose of encapsulation is: 1. To group data and methods together, to create
a class. 2. To control the how the (class) group of date and methods can be used.``

3. How do you instantiate an instance of a class? How do you access that instance?
`` You instantiate an instance by using a constructor. You can access that
instance by calling on the constructor.``
`` use new key work and call it using its object name.  object is an instance of
a class. instance properties and instance methods which you access through the
object. ``

4. What is the default access of the ﬁelds and methods of a class? How do you change the default?
`` The default access of fields and methods is private. You can change the default
by changing private to public.``
`` a field is just a variable. ``

5. What is the syntax for writing a constructor ?
`` The syntax for writing a constructor is a public access, the same name as the
method, and then parameters ``

6. What is the diﬀerence between class ﬁelds and methods, and instance ﬁelds and
methods? How do you create class ﬁelds and methods?
***Instance fields and methods are called through the object, and class fields and
methods are used by call the class name.***
`` you access instance using object name you access class field and methods by
using the access names.``
instance is a method that belongs to the individual object created in class, you
access it using the name of the object associated with the thing.

7. How do you bring a static class in scope? Why would you want to bring a
static class in scope?
***Static using statements. Don't do it.***
`` Static class cannot create objects of that class. ```

8. Can you think of a good reason to create an anonymous class ? What is it?
`` You could create an anonymous class when you don't want to identify a data type.``
`` A class that does not have a name, because you have so many class you don't
want to name them all.``

9. What is polymorphism as this term is used in computer science? This is not
in the book.
`` Polymorphism is being able to appear in many forms, this is important in Objects
oriented programing because you are able to process different objects with the
same methods.``

10. What is message passing as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.
`` How the computer runs the code (program)``
***tell an object to do something and don't care how object does it.***

11. What was the ﬁrst object-oriented programming language?
``Simula``
``common list``

12. Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov:
I ﬁnd OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of
interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need
multi-sorted algebras — families of interfaces that span multiple types. I ﬁnd
OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it
is true it is not very interesting — saying that everything is an object is
saying nothing at all. Who is Alexander Stephanov? What do you think about this quote?

`` Alexander Stephanov is a retired computer programmer, he mostly know for
designing and implementing C++ Standard Template Library. I think it means that
OOP is too simple or basic to be able to solve real problems. In order to solve
"real" problems we can not simply define objects we have to let objects be fluid
things capable of change and adaptation.``
