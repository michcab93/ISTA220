1. What is a local variable?

A local variable is a variable that exist only in a method or
another small section of code

* variable = name location in memory that holds a value
* a variable only available in a block of memory, with in {}

1. What is a statement?

A statement is a command that performs actions, such as calculating
a value and storing the results or displaying a message to a user.

What is the difference between expression and statement>

an expression is a term that evaluates to a value
2+2 is an expression because it evaluate to a value
ends with :

a  statement is a command that instructs computer to execute
ends with ;


1. What is an identifier?

Identifiers are the names that you use to identify the element in
your programs such as namespaces, classes, methods, and variables.
  * you can use only letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits and
  underscore characters
  * an identifier must star with the letter or an underscore

1. What is a variable?

A variable is a storage location that holds a value.
	* For example, if you want to store the value of the cost of
	an item in a store, you might create a variable simply called
	cost and store the item's cost in this variable. Later on, if
	you refer to the cost variable, the value retrieved will be
	the item's cost that you store earlier.

1. What is a method?

A method is a combination of statements

-name block of statements that has a behavior to it. Incapsulation of
behavior.-

1. Are primitive types and values types the same thing?
This is not in the book.

A value type a variable that can be assigned value directly. A
primitive type is a kind of value type which is main built-in.

- yes they are the same thing -

1. How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?

Arithmetic operators "operate" on values / variable types to
create new values / variable types.

- specific arithmetic operators are applicable to specific the
variable type -



1. How do you turn a string into an interger?

The .NET Framework provides a method called Int32.Parse that
converts string value to an interger if you need to performs
arithmetic computations on values held as strings.

- ToString() turns an interger into a string -

1. What is the difference between precedence and associativity?
Give an example where the it makes a difference.

In controlling precedence the multiplicative operators (*,/,%) have
precedence over the additive operators (+,-). In associativity the
aperants are evaluated from left to right.

Example of controlling precedence: if you have the line 1+2*3 you
would muntiply first 2*3 = 6 then add 1+6 = 7
If you did not use controlling precedence and executed line from
left to right then answer would be 1+2 = 3, 3*3 = 9

Highest precedence operator is (), the lowest precendence operator
is = (assignment)


1. What is the definite assignment rule?

Assignment operator associates from right to left. The right - most
assignment occurs firstm and the value assigned propagates through
the variables from right to left. if any variables previously had a
value, it is overwritten by the value being assigned.

Example
myInt5 = myInt4 = myInt3 = myInt2 = myInt = 10
all variables will be assinged the value of 10

- must give a value to every variable -


1. How are the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators
evaluated differently?

In the postfix (x++, or x--) the variable x occurs first so its value
is used as the value of the expression before it is acted on.
In the prefix (++x, or --x) the operator occurs first so the value of
x changes

1. What is a string interpolation?

String interpolation facilitates the interconnection of string type of
variables by replacing + with use of $ at the start of the string and
by evaluating the results of expression placed between {}

- put variable names in a string, it will replace the strings for a
variable value -

1. What does the var keyword do?

The var keyword postulates the type of variable used from the type of
expression that is used.
