1. What is a compound assignment operator ? How does it work?

`` A compound assignment changes the value of variable and then assigns the
result back to itself. A variable  is created (variable) answer = 20 combines an
arithmetic operator and an assignment operator like *= and puts them together.
answer += 3, what this does in actuality is conduct the arithmetic operator on
the variable 20 + 3 = 23 and then assigns the result back to the variable.
answer = 23``

2. List all the compound assignment operators.
* =
/=
%=
+=
-=


3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to
decrement a numeric variable by 50.

`` two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5 is variable += 5, or declare
the increment as a variable, int increment = 5, int variable = 0, variable =
variable + increment``

`` two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50 is variable -= 50, or declare
the increment as a variable, int decrement = 50, int variable = 0, variable =
variable - decrement.``


4. How long does a while loop run?

`` A while loop runs until the Boolean expression evaluates to false.``


5. What happens if you don't change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?

`` it goes for ever because it evaluates to the same thing over and over again.``

6. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?

`` A for loop has 3 parts (initialization, Boolean expression, and update controlvariable), and you can omit any of them but they all consequences. If you omit the Boolean expression it defaults to true and the loop will run forever. if you omit the initialization and update parts it will look strange.``

7. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?

``Use a DO While loop.``

8. What does the break statement do? Breaks you out of the body of an iteration statement.

`` The break statement breaks out of the loop and executes the first statement
that follows.``

9. What does the continue statement do?

`` The continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately after reevaluating the Boolean expression.``
