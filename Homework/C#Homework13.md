1. What is an interface as the term is used on object-oriented programming?

``is a programming structure/syntax that allows the computer to enforce certain
properties on an object (class).``

2. How do you define an interface?

``interface I, No``

3. How do you define a method in an interface?

``You declare your interface the { declare the method(object obj);}``

4. Can you instantiate an object through an interface? Why or why not?

``Yes; because a class and its objects inherit any methods specified by its
interface.``

5. Using the new keyword, can you declare a reference to an interface?

``Yes``

6. Can an object inherit from multiple interfaces? Can a class implement multiple
interfaces? If so, how can it do so?

``yes they can reference multiple interfaces.``

7. What does it mean to explicitly implement an interface?

``you specify which interface a method belongs to when you implement it.``

8.What are the restrictions on interfaces?

``Not allowed to define any fields in an interface.
Not allowed to define constructors in an interface.
Not allowed to define a destructor in an interface.
Cannot specify an access modifier for any method
Cannot nest any types inside an interface.
Interface is not allowed to inherit from a structure or a class.``

9. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?

``The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than
one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class.``

10. What is an abstract method?

``is implicitly a virtual method. Abstract method declarations are only
permitted in abstract classes.``

11. What is an sealed class?

``are used to restrict the inheritance feature of object oriented programming.
Once a class is defined as a sealed class, the class cannot be inherited``

12. What is an sealed method?

``separates implementation from behaviors ``
