1. What is a *method*?
`` a way of packaging code that process and returns a value``
`` (book) Method is a named sequence of statements``
`` *Is it like the SELECT clause*?``

2. What does a *return* statement do?
`` return statement provides a result value for the method used.``
`` return also identifies the end of a method. It terminates process of the
method and provides a result, (returns a value)``

3. What is an *expression bodied* method?
`` Expression bodied methods are methods that are simple, such as performing only
one task, or returning the result without involving logic, and can be written
in a single expression without using method body.``
`` methods written in straight line with out using multiple lines and
method body statement and return statement.``

4. What is the *scope* of a variable?
``The scope of a variable is where, and when a variable can be used at a
particular section in a program.``

5. What is an *overloaded* method?
``when two identifiers have the same name and are declared in the same scope,
they are said to be overloaded``

6. How do you call a method that requirements *arguments*?
`` results = methodName(argumentList)``

7. How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that
requires a *parameter list*?
`` put the paramenter list in the parenthases, seperated by comas, specify the
variable type.``

8. How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method?
``You specify that a parameter is optional when you define a method by providing
a default value for the parameter by using the assignment operator.``


9. How do you pass an argument to a method as a *named parameter*?

``To pass an argument as a named parameter, you specify the name of the parameter,
followed by a colon and the value to use.``

10. How do you return values from a method? Can you return multiple values from
a method, and if so, how?
``by returning a tuple``

11. How does the compiler resolve an ambiguity between named arguments and
optional parameters?
``If the method is an unresolvable ambiguity, and the compiler does not let you
compile the application.``
